Predictive UNcertainty Calibration and Conformalization (PUNCC) is an open-source library that enables ad-hoc integration of AI models into a theoretically sound uncertainty estimation framework based on conformal prediction. Prediction sets are constructed with guaranteed coverage probability according to a nominal level of error $\alpha$.

# üêæ Installation

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone ssh://git@forge.deel.ai:22012/statistic-guarantees/puncc.git
```

## Installation

It is recommended to install puncc in a virtual environment to not mess with your system's dependencies.

#### For users
```bash
pip install -e .[interactive]
```

#### For developpers

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

You can alternatively use the makefile to automatically create a virtual environment
`puncc-dev-env` and install the dev requiments:

```bash
make prepare-dev
```


# üöÄ Quickstart

Let‚Äôs consider a simple regression problem on diabetes data provided by Scikit-learn. We want to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the prediction using inductive (or split) conformal prediction.

### Data

By construction, data are indepent and identically distributed (i.i.d) (for
more information, check the official
[documentation](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html).
Great: we fullfill the exchangeability condition to apply conformal prediction!
The next step is spliting the data into three subsets:

* Fit subset ${\cal D_{fit}}$ to train the model.
* Calibration subset ${\cal D_{calib}}$ on which nonconformity scores are
  computed.
* Test subset ${\cal D_{test}}$ on which the prediction intervals are
  estimated.

---
**NOTE**

   Rigorously, for the probabilistic guarantee to hold, the calibration subset
   needs to be sampled for each new example in the test set.

---


The following code implements all the aforementioned steps:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes_X, diabetes_y = datasets.load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)

# Use only one feature
diabetes_X = diabetes_X[:, np.newaxis, 2]

# Split the data into training/testing sets
X_train = diabetes_X[:-100]
X_test = diabetes_X[-100:]

# Split the targets into training/testing sets
y_train = diabetes_y[:-100]
y_test = diabetes_y[-100:]

# Split fit and calibration data
X_fit, X_calib = X_train[:-100], X_train[-100:]
y_fit, y_calib = y_train[:-100], y_train[-100:]
```
## Prediction Model

We consider a simple linear regression model from
[scikit-learn regression module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html),
to be trained later on ${\cal D_{fit}}$:

```python
from sklearn import linear_model

# Create linear regression model
lin_reg_model = linear_model.LinearRegression()
```

Such model needs to be wrapped in a wrapper provided in the module
`deel.puncc.api.prediction`.
The wrapper makes it possible to use various models from different ML/DL
libraries such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/),
[Keras](https://keras.io/) or
[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
For more information about model wrappers and supported ML/DL libraries,
we refere the user to the documentation.

For a linear regression from scikit-learn, we use `deel.puncc.api.prediction.BasePredictor` as follows:

```python
from deel.puncc.api.prediction import BasePredictor

# Create a predictor to wrap the linear regression model defined earlier
# The argument `is_trained` is set to False such that the linear model needs to be
# trained before the calibration. You can initialize it to True if the model is
# already trained and you want to save time.
lin_reg_predictor =  BasePredictor(lin_reg_model, is_trained=False)
```


## Split Conformal Regression
For this example, the prediction intervals are obtained throught the split
conformal prediction method provided by the class
`deel.puncc.regression.SplitCP`. Other methods are presented
in the documentation.


```python
from deel.puncc.regression import SplitCP

# Coverage target is 1-alpha = 90%
alpha=.1

# Instanciate the split cp wrapper around the linear predictor.
split_cp = SplitCP(lin_reg_predictor)

# Train model (if argument `is_train` is False) on the fitting dataset and
# compute the residuals on the calibration dataset.
split_cp.fit(X_fit, y_fit, X_calib, y_calib)

# The `predict` returns the output of the linear model `y_pred` and
# the calibrated interval [`y_pred_lower`, `y_pred_upper`].
y_pred, y_pred_lower, y_pred_upper = split_cp.predict(X_test, alpha=alpha)
```

The library provides several metrics in `deel.puncc.metrics` to evaluate
the conformalization procedure. Below, we compute the average empirical coverage
and the average empirical width of the prediction intervals on the test examples:

```python
from deel.puncc import metrics

coverage = metrics.regression_mean_coverage(y_test, y_pred_lower, y_pred_upper)
width = metrics.regression_sharpness(y_pred_lower=y_pred_lower,
                                    y_pred_upper=y_pred_upper)
print(f"Marginal coverage: {np.round(coverage, 2)}")
print(f"Average width: {np.round(width, 2)}")
```

In addition, `puncc` provides plotting tools in `deel.puncc.plotting`
to visualize the prediction intervals and whether or not the observations
are covered:

```python
from deel.puncc.plotting import plot_prediction_intervals

# Figure of the prediction bands

ax = plot_prediction_intervals(
        X = X_test[:,0],
        y_true=y_test,
        y_pred=y_pred,
        y_pred_lower=y_pred_lower,
        y_pred_upper=y_pred_upper,
        loc="upper left")
```

![90% Prediction Interval with the Split Conformal Prediction Method](docs/source/results_quickstart_split_cp_pi.png)

In the long run, at least 90% of the examples are included in the prediction interval.

### Further readings: High-level and low-level APIs
The library `puncc` provides two ways of defining and using conformal prediction wrappers:
- **High-level API**: a direct approach to run state of the art conformal prediction procedures. This is what we used in the previous conformal regression example.
- **Low-level API**: a more flexible approach based of full customization of the prediction model, the choice of nonconformity scores and the split between fit and calibration datasets.

A quick comparison of both approaches is provided [here](docs/quickstart.ipynb) for a simple regression problem.

class RAPS:
    """Implementation of Regularized Adaptive Prediction Sets (RAPS).
    The hyperparameters :math:`\\lambda` and :math:`k_{reg}` are used to
    encourage small prediction sets. For more details, we refer the user to the
    :ref:`theory overview page <theory raps>`.

    :param BasePredictor predictor: a predictor implementing fit and predict.
    :param bool train: if False, prediction model(s) will not be trained and
        will be used as is. Defaults to True.
    :param float random_state: random seed used when the user does not
        provide a custom fit/calibration split in `fit` method.
    :param float lambd: positive weight associated to the regularization term
        that encourages small set sizes. If :math:`\\lambda = 0`, there is no
        regularization and the implementation identifies with **APS**.
    :param float k_reg: class rank (ordered by descending probability) starting
        from which the regularization is applied. For example,
        if :math:`k_{reg} = 3`, then the fourth most likely estimated class has
        an extra penalty of size :math:`\\lambda`.
    : param bool rand: turn on or off randomization used in raps algorithm.
        One consequence of turning off randomization is avoiding empty prediction sets.

    .. note::

        If :math:`\\lambda = 0`, there is no regularization and the
        implementation identifies with **APS**.

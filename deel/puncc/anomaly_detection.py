    The anomaly detection is based on the calibrated threshold (through
    conformal prediction) of underlying anomaly detection (model's) scores.
    For more details, we refer the user to the :ref:`theory overview
    page <theory_overview>`.

    :param BasePredictor predictor: a predictor implementing fit and predict.
    :param bool train: if False, prediction model(s) will not be (re)trained.

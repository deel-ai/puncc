    "# ðŸ’» Welcome to the presentation of *puncc*'s architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "*Puncc* enables a turnkey solution and a fully customized approach to conformal prediction. It is as simple as calling the conformal prediction procedures in `deel.puncc.regression` or `deel.puncc.classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently implemented conformal regression procedures are the following:\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.SplitCP`: Split Conformal Prediction\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.LocallyAdaptiveCP`: Locally Adaptive Conformal Prediction\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.CQR`: Conformalized Quantile Regression\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.CvPlus`: CV + (cross-validation)\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.EnbPI`: Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals method\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.regression.aEnbPI`: locally adaptive Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals method\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently implemented conformal classification procedures are the following:\n",
    "* `deel.puncc.classification.APS`: Adaptive Prediction Sets. \n",
    "* `deel.puncc.classification.RAPS`: Regularized Adaptive Prediction Sets. APS is a special case where regularization term is nulled ($\\lambda = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these procedures conformalize point-based or interval-based models that are wrapped in a predictor and passed as argument to the constructor. Wrapping the models in a predictor (`deel.puncc.api.prediction`) enables to work with several ML/DL libraries and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **API** offers more flexibility into defining conformal prediction procedures. Let's say we want to fit/calibrate a neural-network interval-estimator with a cross-validation plan; or that we want to experiment different user-defined nonconformity scores. In such cases and others, the user can fully construct their approaches using the proposed **Predictor-Calibrator-Splitter** paradigm. It boils down to assembling into `puncc.api.conformalization.ConformalPredictor`:\n",
    "1) a predictor\n",
    "2) A calibrator defining a nonconformity score and a procedure to construct/calibrate the prediction sets\n",
    "3) A splitter defining the strategy of data assignement into fitting and calibration sets\n",
